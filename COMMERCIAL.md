# Commercial Licensing — ICDEV

## Open-Source License

ICDEV is free software licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License
v3.0 or later** (AGPL-3.0-or-later). See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text.

Under the AGPL-3.0, you may freely use, modify, and distribute ICDEV provided
that:

- Any modified version you distribute or make available over a network must
  also be released under the AGPL-3.0.
- Users interacting with your modified version over a network must be offered
  access to the corresponding source code.

This means the open-source license is suitable for:

- Internal use (no distribution or network service obligations)
- Academic and research purposes
- Open-source projects that are also AGPL-3.0 compatible
- Personal use and evaluation
- Government agencies using it internally

## When You Need a Commercial License

A commercial license removes the AGPL-3.0 copyleft obligations. You need one if:

- You want to offer ICDEV (or a modified version) as a **hosted SaaS product**
  without releasing your source code
- You want to **embed ICDEV** in a proprietary product or platform
- You want to **redistribute ICDEV** as part of a closed-source offering
- Your organization's legal policy **prohibits AGPL-3.0** dependencies

## Commercial License Tiers

| Tier | Team Size | Annual Price | Includes |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Solo / Startup | < 50 employees | $2,000/year | Non-AGPL use, email support |
| Enterprise | 50-500 employees | $10,000/year | Non-AGPL use, priority support, 1 hr/month consulting |
| Defense / SI | 500+ employees | Negotiated | Non-AGPL use, dedicated support, custom SLA, on-site option |

All tiers include:

- Perpetual use rights for versions released during the license period
- Freedom to modify and deploy without AGPL source-sharing obligations
- Access to private release notes and migration guides

## What the Commercial License Does NOT Change

- You still receive the same source code as the open-source version
- Contributions you make back to the project are welcome (under CLA)
- ICDEV's compliance catalogs and crosswalk mappings remain available to all users
- Security updates are published to both open-source and commercial users

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you contribute code to ICDEV, you will be asked to sign a Contributor
License Agreement. The CLA grants the project maintainer the right to
distribute your contributions under both the AGPL-3.0 and commercial licenses.
This is standard practice for dual-licensed open-source projects (used by
MongoDB, GitLab, Qt, and many others).

The CLA does **not** transfer your copyright. You retain full ownership of your
contributions.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use ICDEV internally at my company under the AGPL-3.0?**
A: Yes. Internal use does not trigger AGPL-3.0 obligations. You only need a
commercial license if you distribute ICDEV or make it available as a network
service to third parties.

**Q: I'm a government contractor. Do I need a commercial license?**
A: If you use ICDEV internally or for a single government customer, the AGPL-3.0
is fine. If you build a product or SaaS that incorporates ICDEV and sell it to
multiple customers, you need a commercial license.

**Q: Can I evaluate ICDEV before purchasing?**
A: Absolutely. The full source code is available under AGPL-3.0. Use it, test it,
evaluate it. Only purchase a commercial license when you need to remove the
copyleft obligations.

**Q: What if I contribute a significant feature? Do I still need to pay?**
A: Major contributors may be eligible for a complimentary commercial license.
