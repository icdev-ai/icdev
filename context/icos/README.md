# ICDEV[OS] application-twin bundle contract (vendored)

`apptwin.schema.json` is ICDEV[OS]'s `icos-apptwin/v1` bundle schema (`urn:icdev-os:contract:apptwin:1`), copied
verbatim from the ICDEV[OS] published contract (`contracts/schemas/apptwin.schema.json`, contract version 1.120.0,
SHA-256 `ec980a9759edcbb26714edd243ac8c4539b1b64dc8b52f6ce21818bd00cfcf51`; 1.120.0 adds a verification result's `subject`). It is licensed Apache-2.0
(`LICENSE`, `NOTICE` here), unlike the rest of this repository.

`tools/modernization/apptwin_export.py` validates every bundle it writes against it and refuses to run if the
file's digest is not the pinned one. To take a newer contract: copy the new schema, update the digest in
`apptwin_export.SCHEMA_SHA256` and this file, and run `tests/test_icx_apptwin_export.py`.
