    "description": "Bidirectional crosswalk mapping Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) requirements to NIST 800-53 Rev 5 controls. MOSA mandates modular architectures with open standards, well-defined interfaces, and data rights strategies for DoD acquisition programs per 10 U.S.C. 4401. Implementing a NIST 800-53 control auto-satisfies all MOSA requirements that map to it via the crosswalk engine dual-hub model (ADR D111)."
