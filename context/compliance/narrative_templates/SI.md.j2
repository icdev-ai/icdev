### Implementation Narrative

{{ implementation_detail }}
{% else %}
This control has not yet been fully documented. Evidence gathering is in progress.
{% endif %}

### Flaw Remediation SLA

{% if control_id == "SI-2" or control_id.startswith("SI-2(") %}
The organization identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws in accordance with the following service level agreements:

- **Critical Severity (CVSS 9.0-10.0):** Remediation within 15 calendar days of identification. Emergency patches may be deployed outside the standard change window with ISSO approval.
- **High Severity (CVSS 7.0-8.9):** Remediation within 30 calendar days. Mitigating controls must be documented within 72 hours if the patch cannot be applied immediately.
- **Medium Severity (CVSS 4.0-6.9):** Remediation within 90 calendar days during the next scheduled maintenance window.
- **Low Severity (CVSS 0.1-3.9):** Remediation within 180 calendar days or the next major release cycle.
- **Tracking:** All identified flaws are tracked in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) with assigned owners, milestones, and estimated completion dates. SLA compliance is reported monthly.
- **Testing:** Flaw remediation patches are tested in a staging environment prior to production deployment. Regression testing confirms that patches do not introduce new vulnerabilities or degrade functionality.
- **Vendor Notifications:** The organization monitors vendor security advisories, CISA alerts, and IAVA/IAVB notifications for applicable flaws and initiates remediation within SLA timelines.
{% else %}
Flaw remediation SLAs are documented under SI-2. This control ({{ control_id }}) operates within the established flaw remediation framework.
{% endif %}

### Malicious Code Protection

{% if control_id == "SI-3" or control_id.startswith("SI-3(") %}
The system employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points:

- **Endpoint Protection:** Anti-malware/endpoint detection and response (EDR) software is deployed on all endpoints and servers. Definitions and signatures are updated automatically.
- **Real-Time Scanning:** Real-time scanning is enabled for file system access, email attachments, and web downloads. On-access scanning detects malicious code at the point of introduction.
- **Scheduled Scanning:** Full system scans are performed at the organizationally defined frequency (minimum weekly) during periods of low system utilization.
- **Automatic Response:** Upon detection of malicious code, the system automatically quarantines the affected file, blocks the associated process, alerts the security operations team, and generates an audit record.
- **False Positive Management:** False positive detections are reviewed, documented, and addressed through signature exclusion policies maintained by the security team.
- **Container Scanning:** Container images are scanned for malware and known-vulnerable components prior to deployment. Runtime container monitoring detects anomalous process execution.
{% else %}
Malicious code protection is documented under SI-3. This control ({{ control_id }}) supports the malware defense architecture.
{% endif %}

### Information System Monitoring Tools

{% if control_id == "SI-4" or control_id.startswith("SI-4(") %}
The organization monitors the information system to detect attacks, indicators of potential attacks, unauthorized connections, and anomalous behavior:

- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Network-based IDS/IPS is deployed at managed network interfaces to detect and prevent known attack signatures and anomalous traffic patterns.
- **Host-Based Monitoring:** Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) and file integrity monitoring (FIM) are deployed on critical servers to detect unauthorized changes to system files, configurations, and binaries.
- **Log Aggregation:** Security-relevant logs from all system components are aggregated in a centralized SIEM platform for correlation, analysis, and alerting. Log forwarding uses encrypted channels.
- **Behavioral Analytics:** User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) tools establish baseline behavior profiles and alert on deviations that may indicate compromised accounts or insider threats.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Network flow data (NetFlow/sFlow) is collected and analyzed to identify anomalous communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts, and command-and-control traffic.
- **Alert Management:** Monitoring alerts are triaged based on severity and confidence. High-fidelity alerts trigger automated incident response workflows. Alert fatigue is mitigated through tuning and correlation.
{% else %}
Information system monitoring tools are documented under SI-4. This control ({{ control_id }}) contributes to the overall continuous monitoring capability.
{% endif %}

### Software and Firmware Integrity Verification

{% if control_id == "SI-7" or control_id.startswith("SI-7(") %}
The organization employs integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware:

- **Integrity Checking:** Cryptographic hash verification (SHA-256 minimum) is used to validate software and firmware integrity at boot time, at defined intervals, and upon notification of potential compromise.
- **Supply Chain Verification:** Software packages are verified against publisher-provided signatures or checksums before installation. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated and maintained for all deployed software.
- **Code Signing:** All internally developed code is digitally signed prior to deployment. Signature verification is enforced at deployment time; unsigned or tampered code is rejected.
- **Firmware Protections:** Firmware updates are applied only from authenticated sources with verified digital signatures. Secure boot is enabled where supported by hardware.
- **Automated Detection:** Automated integrity monitoring tools generate alerts when unauthorized modifications are detected. Automated response includes notification, quarantine, and rollback to a known-good state.
- **Baseline Management:** A cryptographic baseline of authorized software and firmware versions is maintained. Deviations from the baseline trigger investigation and remediation.
{% else %}
Software and firmware integrity verification is documented under SI-7. This control ({{ control_id }}) supports the integrity assurance framework.
{% endif %}

### Evidence

{% if evidence_items %}
{% for item in evidence_items %}
- **{{ item.source }}** ({{ item.date | default("N/A") }}): {{ item.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No formal evidence has been collected for this control.
{% endif %}

### Assessment History

{% if audit_events %}
| Date | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
{% for event in audit_events[:10] %}
| {{ event.created_at | default("N/A") }} | {{ event.actor | default("system") }} | {{ event.action | default("") }} |
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No assessment history available.
{% endif %}

### Related Framework Mappings

{% if crosswalk_mappings %}
{% for mapping in crosswalk_mappings %}
- **{{ mapping.framework }}**: {{ mapping.requirement_id }} ({{ mapping.status | default("not_assessed") }})
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No crosswalk mappings available for this control.
{% endif %}
