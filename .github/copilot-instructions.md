# Copilot Instructions — ICDEV Project

This is an ICDEV-managed project (IL4, CUI).

## Coding Standards

- All Python files must begin with `# CUI // SP-CTI`
- Use snake_case naming convention
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Tests required: pytest (unit) + behave (BDD)
- Minimum coverage: 80%

## Architecture

GOTCHA framework: deterministic Python tools in `tools/` with `--json` output. Read `goals/manifest.md` for workflows, `tools/manifest.md` for available tools.

## Key Commands

```bash
python tools/project/session_context_builder.py --format markdown  # Project context
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short                                         # Unit tests
behave features/                                                    # BDD tests
python tools/security/sast_runner.py --project-dir . --json         # Security scan
python tools/compliance/stig_checker.py --project-id "" --json  # STIG check
```

## Compliance

- fedramp_moderate

Security gates block on: CAT1 STIG, critical vulns, failed tests, missing CUI markings.

## CUI Markings

Every generated file must include classification marking `# CUI // SP-CTI` as the first comment line.


## Prompt Files

Custom workflows available in `.github/prompts/`:
- `icdev-build.prompt.md` — TDD build cycle
- `icdev-test.prompt.md` — Full test suite
- `icdev-comply.prompt.md` — Compliance artifacts
- `icdev-secure.prompt.md` — Security scanning

Reference with `#prompt:icdev-build` in Copilot Chat.
