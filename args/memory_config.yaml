time_decay:
  # Exponential decay formula: decay_factor = 2^(-(age_days / half_life_days))
  # Per-type half-lives (in days)
  half_lives:
    fact: 90          # Long-lived — organizational knowledge
    preference: 180   # Very long-lived — user/system preferences rarely change
    event: 7          # Short-lived — session events lose relevance quickly
    insight: 30       # Medium — insights remain useful for ~1 month
    task: 14          # Short-medium — task context relevant during sprint
    relationship: 120 # Long-lived — people/system relationships persist

  # Default half-life for unknown memory types
  default_half_life: 30

  # Minimum decay factor (prevents ancient entries from being completely zeroed)
  min_decay_factor: 0.01

  # Scoring weights when time-decay is enabled (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    relevance: 0.60    # BM25 + semantic hybrid score
    recency: 0.25      # Time decay factor
    importance: 0.15   # Normalized importance (importance / 10.0)

  # Override: if importance >= this threshold, halve the decay effect
  # (very important memories resist decay)
