# Veto behavior:
# hard = blocks output immediately, requires human override via approval_workflow
# soft = warns orchestrator, orchestrator can override with justification logged
#
# Adding new authority:
# 1. Add a new agent entry with veto_type and topics
# 2. The authority.py module will pick it up automatically
# 3. No code changes required
#
# Topic naming convention:
# - Use snake_case
# - Be specific enough to avoid false positives
# - Group related concerns under a single topic when they share review criteria
